Made a Simple but interesting PassWord generator app using React Native.
Played with hooks in React Native.
Used and Learned about Formik and Bouncy CheckBox.
The app has different checkboxes by which one can select what type of password he/she wants. The password can include lowercase Characters, uppercase characters, numbers and symbols.
Now keep your accounts safe by generating strong passwords using my appðŸ˜‰
